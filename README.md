# Cog Implementation of ControlNet

This is a implementation of the Controlnets (Depth, Scribble, Lineart) for Cog. 
You can use any TxtToImg Models, just replace the current Model.

How to use: 

Download the weights by running "cog run python script/download_weights"

Then you can push the Model to Replicate by running cog login and cog push.
